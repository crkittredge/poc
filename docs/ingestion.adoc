## Ingestion Framework

It is a config driven framework written in Java that makes it easy to ingest data from sources like Files, Relational Databases and PubSub into BigQuery. The Framework also has support for
standardizing  and sorting(finding the latest record ) the data. All the three are defined as flow with each having its own config inside the flow

        flow{
            ingestion{
            }
            transformation{
            }
            latestrecord{
            }
        }
